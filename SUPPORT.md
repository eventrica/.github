# Support

Support is currently not formally available for any part of the Eventrica ecosystem.
GitHub issues will be triaged on a "best effort" basis until a formal support mechanism exists,
but no promises can be made regarding timeliness of support, or the ability to dedicate
significant time to doing so, at this stage.
